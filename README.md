# BookMySalon

"BookMySalon" app using a microservices architecture means decomposing the application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Here are potential microservices for such a backend, though the exact requirements will depend on your specific use cases:

1. **User Service**
    - User registration, authentication, and management.
    - Handles user profiles, preferences, and settings.

2. **Salon Service**
    - Manages salon details: name, address, services provided, prices, photos, etc.
    - Tracks salon ratings and reviews.

3. **Appointment Service**
    - Manages appointment bookings: creation, updates, cancellations.
    - Sends notifications (e.g., reminders, appointment confirmations).

4. **Search and Discovery Service**
    - Allows users to search for salons based on different criteria: location, service type, ratings, etc.
    - Provides salon recommendations if needed.

5. **Availability Service**
    - Checks the availability of slots in a given salon.
    - Helps in real-time slot allocation during booking.

6. **Payment Service**
    - Processes transactions, manages invoicing.
    - Handles promotions, discounts, and loyalty points if applicable.

7. **Review and Rating Service**
    - Allows users to rate and review salons and specific services.
    - Helps maintain a feedback loop for salons.

8. **Notification Service**
    - Sends out notifications via email, SMS, or in-app push notifications.
    - Handles both transactional notifications (like booking confirmations) and promotional ones.

9. **Analytics Service**
    - Tracks user behavior, bookings, cancellations, popular services, etc.
    - Provides insights to salons and app administrators.

10. **Admin Service**
- For platform administrators to manage salons, view reports, handle disputes, etc.

11. **Loyalty and Promotions Service**
- Manages loyalty programs, discount codes, special offers, etc.

12. **Integration Service**
- If you're integrating with other platforms or external services, this service will handle those integrations. For instance, integrating with Google Maps to show salon locations.

13. **Inventory and Resource Management Service** (if needed)
- If salons want to list the availability of specific resources (e.g., particular hairstylists or specific equipment).

14. **Chat or Support Service**
- To provide customer support, handle inquiries, or even allow user-to-salon direct communication.

Remember that while microservices offer various advantages like independent scaling and deployment, they also introduce complexity in terms of service orchestration, data consistency, and inter-service communication. Properly designing the inter-communication between these services using tools like message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) and ensuring their resilience with patterns like Circuit Breaker can be crucial for the success of your application.

Explanation:

cmd/: This contains the entry points for different microservices. Each microservice will have its main application here.

pkg/: Shared libraries and packages that can be used across different services. This ensures code reusability and separation.

services/: This is where the actual microservices reside. Each service has its directory and contains its handlers, data models, and DB operations. Keeping each microservice in a separate directory makes the codebase organized.

database.go and jwt.go have been moved inside pkg/ since they can be considered as common functionalities that might be used across multiple services.

Inside each service directory (like user), having separate files for handlers, models, and database operations (repository pattern) helps in keeping concerns separated and the code more organized.

Remember, this is just a suggested structure, and the best directory/package structure often depends on the project's specific needs and the team's preferences. However, the above structure is scalable and helps in maintaining a large codebase with multiple microservices.
